To make Docker use the proxy, you will have to configure dockerd. One way to do this is to create the file /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/proxy.conf with the following content:

```bash
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://10.0.0.10:7890"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.0.0.10:7890"
```

Once this file is in place, you need to restart the Docker service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

配置好了后,就可以试试了哒

```bash
docker pull hello-world
```
